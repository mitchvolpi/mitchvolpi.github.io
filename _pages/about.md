Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you can find information about myself, my research and project I work on. 

I am a Senior Data Scientist at the Swiss Data Science Center, sitting at the ETH Zurich office. I work on research projects involving machine learning and computer vision for environmental applications, such as Earth observation, biodiversity monitoring, natural hazard forecasting, mapping and climate sciences.
